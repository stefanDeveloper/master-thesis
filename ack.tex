The research included in this thesis could not have been performed if not for many individuals' assistance, patience, and support. 
 
First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Vincent Heuveline for his valuable and constructive input.
Without his guidance and mentorship,
I would not have been able to finish this thesis.
Moreover, I grew as a researcher, and I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to continue my research as a future Ph.D. candidate under his supervision. 

I want to extend my gratitude towards Stefan Steiger and Olaf Pichler from the Computing Centre at Heidelberg University.
Thank you for offering insightful comments and brilliant suggestions when the task got challenging.
They always had time and provided me with ample support no matter what happened.

I am indebted to Joachim Peek for generously agreeing to examine my results and providing valuable inputs.
His timely advice and scientific knowledge helped me understand essential parts of the topic assisted me to a great extent in accomplishing this task.

Lastly, I could not have completed this thesis without the support of my girlfriend, Carmen.
Thank you for being so patient in providing emotional support and stimulating discussions during my research.
