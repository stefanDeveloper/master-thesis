Protecting network accessible Cloud resources and services from ever increasing cyber threats is of great concern. Most of the Network based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) being rule based and therefore only capable of identifying known attacks (through pattern matching). Traditional Anomaly Detection based IDS may generate more number of false positives.},
