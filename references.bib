  abstract  = {With the rapid evolution and proliferation of botnets, large-scale cyber attacks such
as DDoS, spam emails are also becoming more and more dangerous and serious cyber threats.
Because of this, network based security technologies such as Network based Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), firewalls have received
remarkable attention to defend our crucial computer systems, networks and sensitive
information from attackers on the Internet. In particular, there has been much effort
towards high-performance NIDSs based on data mining and machine learning techniques.
However, there is a fatal problem in that the existing evaluation dataset, called
KDD Cup 99' dataset, cannot reflect current network situations and the latest attack
trends. This is because it was generated by simulation over a virtual network more
than 10 years ago. To the best of our knowledge, there is no alternative evaluation
dataset. In this paper, we present a new evaluation dataset, called Kyoto 2006+, built
on the 3 years of real traffic data (Nov. 2006 ~ Aug. 2009) which are obtained from
diverse types of honeypots. Kyoto 2006+ dataset will greatly contribute to IDS researchers
in obtaining more practical, useful and accurate evaluation results. Furthermore,
we provide detailed analysis results of honeypot data and share our experiences so
that security researchers are able to get insights into the trends of latest cyber
attacks and the Internet situations.},
